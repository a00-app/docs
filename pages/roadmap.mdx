# a00 Roadmap

This roadmap outlines phased development for a00 across testnets, mainnet readiness, economics, provider ecosystem, governance, and long‑term compliance.

## Phase 0 — Foundation & Testnets
- Deploy A00, Faucet, and Vault to Nebulas testnet; internal security review.
- Public faucet for onboarding; documentation and quickstart SDK/CLI.
- Observability: indexers for Vault balances, consumption metrics, and pricing reports.
- Incentivized testnet: storage fee estimation campaign with rewards for early adopters.

## Phase 1 — Mainnet Beta & Core Economics
- Vault mainnet beta on Solaris; pricing v1 with MiB‑based deductions.
- SDK/CLI 1.0, status dashboard, and billing exports for teams.
- External audit #1 and public bug bounty launch.
- Design partners pilot with volume limits and SLO targets.

## Phase 2 — Providers, Staking & SLA Signals
- On‑chain provider registry with bonding/staking requirements.
- SLA telemetry and proofs for availability; pricing oracles integration.
- Scalable settlement: batched `pay()` and pagination patterns for large holder sets.
- Research track: verifiable metering proofs to replace trusted owner updates.

## Phase 3 — Governance & Liquidity
- Governance bootstrap: multisig → community council → DAO proposal flow.
- Token liquidity programs; emissions schedule and treasury policy disclosures.
- Ecosystem grants and hackathons for storage tooling and integrations.
- Audit #2 covering staking, registry, and treasury modules.

## Phase 4 — Scale & Interop
- Bridging and interoperability with L2s/sidechains; cross‑chain accounting.
- Provider marketplace launch; reputation scores and price discovery.
- Edge and CDN partners for hot paths; cold storage alliances for archives.
- Enterprise features: SSO, invoice billing, usage caps, and RBAC.

## Phase 5 — Sustainability & Compliance
- Compliance tracks (SOC2/ISO) and data residency controls.
- Custody/fiat on‑ramps for institutional users; stablecoin settlement.
- Long‑term durability insurance and ecosystem endowment.
- Continuous audits and formal methods for critical contracts.
