## Overview
Team tokens will be locked for 6 months with a linear vesting schedule over the following 12 months. Lock countdown won't start until the 3 major milestones are achieved: *MVP*, *A00 Nodes*, *Encrypted File Storage*.

Tokens allocated for node owners will be distributed based on their node's storage capacity and uptime. The more storage capacity and better uptime a node has, the larger share of the allocated tokens it will receive. Tokens are distributed every 3 hours to active nodes.

0.6% of the total supply is kept in the creator wallet as vault balance. This balance is unwithdrawable and will be only used for future development and testing. Since this balance is unwithdrawable, it won't affect the circulating supply.
