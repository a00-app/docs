# Usage

a00.js has 3 main methods. First, you need to initialize the A00 class with the API key.

You can get your API key from [a00.app Settings](https://a00.app/settings).

```typescript
import { A00 } from "a00.js";

const a00 = new A00("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Uploading files

`upload` method returns the uploaded file's ID, CID, and metadata.

```typescript
// Returns an object, which is needed for deleting & downloading files in future
const file = await a00.upload("./path/to/file");

/**
 * @returns {
 * id: string;
 *  cid: string;
 *  metadata: {
 *      name: string;
 *      size: number;
 *      extension: string
 *  };
 *  createdAt: Date;
 * }
*/
```

## Downloading files

```typescript
const content = await a00.get(file.id);
```

Then you can save the file

```typescript
fs.writeFileSync(`./${file}.txt`, content);
```

## Deleting files

Delete a specific file by its ID.

```typescript
a00.delete(file.id);
```

Delete all files uploaded by user

```typescript
a00.deleteAll();
```
