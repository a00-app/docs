# Usage

a00.js has 3 main methods. First, you need to initialize the A00 class with the API key.

You can get your API key from [a00.app Settings](https://a00.app/settings).

```typescript
import { A00 } from "a00.js";

const a00 = new A00("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Uploading files

`upload` method returns the uploaded file's CID.

```typescript
// Returns a CID, which is needed for deleting & downloading files in future
const file = await a00.upload("./path/to/file");
```

## Downloading files

```typescript
const content = await a00.get(file);
```

Then you can save the file

```typescript
fs.writeFileSync(`./${file}.txt`, content);
```

## Deleting files

```typescript
a00.delete(file);
```
